# Playwright Project Setup 🎭

## Introduction 🌟
This README provides the necessary steps and commands to set up a Playwright testing environment for your project.

## 👷🏽‍♂️ Installation
Install Playwright with one of these commands:
```bash
npm init playwright@latest
# or
yarn create playwright
# or
pnpm create playwright
```
During installation, make choices for language (JavaScript), test directory, GitHub Actions, and browser downloads.

## 🚀 Running Tests
Run your tests using these commands (add `--headed` to run in a headed browser):
```bash
# Runs all tests in the tests folder
npx playwright test 

# Runs tests with 3 workers in parallel
npx playwright test --workers 3

# Run a specific test file
npx playwright test tests/example.spec.js 

# Run tests by file name
npx playwright test tests example

# Run a specific test within a file by title
npx playwright test -g "title"
```

## 📊 Test Reports
Generate an HTML report of your tests:
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

## 🐛 Debug Mode
Run tests in debug mode:
```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```

Enable/disable tracing (UI for Debugging) via command line:
```bash
npx playwright test --trace on
```

## 🎞️ Record Mode 
Record manual test execution to generate code:
```bash
npx playwright codegen

# Emulate an iPhone in Record Mode
npx playwright codegen --device="iPhone 14"
```

## 🖥️ UI Mode
Enhance development experience with UI mode:
```bash
npx playwright test --ui
```

## ⬆️ Updating Playwright
Update to the latest version:
```bash
npm install -D @playwright/test@latest
```

Verify Playwright version:
```bash
npx playwright --version
```

### XPath Locators
Identify independent XPath locators on inspect, e.g.:
```html
//input[@name='replace_with_name_property']
```

### Pausing Test Execution
Pause a run at a specific step using:
```javascript
await page.pause()
```

### Assertions
Different assertions examples:
```javascript
await expect(page.locator('your locator')).toBeVisible()
await expect(page.locator('your locator')).toBeHidden()
await expect(page.locator('your locator')).toBeEnabled()
await expect(page.locator('your locator')).toBeDisabled()
await expect(page.locator('text=example')).toHaveText('example')
```

### Soft Assertions
Assert multiple objects without stopping the run:
```javascript
await expect.soft(page.locator('your locator')).toBeVisible()
```
